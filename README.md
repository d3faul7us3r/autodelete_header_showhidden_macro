# autodelete_header_showhidden_macro

* This is a basic macro, set to delete a header you have created and show hidden text.
  * Tip: 
    * Select text you would like to hide, open up Font Box and Select (Hidden). 
    * Macro only works once since most Microsoft Word Applications have show hidden off by default.
